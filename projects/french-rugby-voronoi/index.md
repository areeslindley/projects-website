# French Rugby Geographic Analysis: Voronoi Diagrams

## Project Overview

Rugby union is deeply embedded in French culture, particularly in the southwest. This analysis explores the geographic distribution of professional rugby teams across France using Voronoi diagrams to visualize territorial "catchment areas" for Top 14 and Pro D2 clubs.

## Motivation

As a lifelong rugby player and analyst, I wanted to understand:
- Which areas of France are "closest" to each professional rugby club
- How team territories divide the country geographically
- Whether the traditional rugby heartlands in the southwest dominate territorially

## Methodology

This project uses:
- **Geospatial analysis**: Voronoi tessellation to partition France based on proximity to team locations
- **Data visualization**: Interactive and static maps showing team territories
- **Coordinate geometry**: Calculating boundaries between team catchment areas

## Key Findings

The analysis reveals:
- Clear geographic clustering in traditional rugby regions (Occitanie, Nouvelle-Aquitaine)
- Sparse coverage in northern France despite population density
- Territorial dominance by southwestern clubs

## Technical Stack

- **Python**: Core analysis language
- **GeoPandas**: Geospatial data manipulation
- **Shapely**: Geometric operations and Voronoi tessellation
- **Matplotlib/Folium**: Visualization libraries
- **SciPy**: Spatial algorithms
